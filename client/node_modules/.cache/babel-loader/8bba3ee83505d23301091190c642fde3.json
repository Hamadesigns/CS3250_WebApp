Tips for Writing a Great \\u2018About Me\\u2019 Page Decide if you want to use first or third person. Should you use first or third person, what\\u2019s the difference, and why does it matter? First person involves the use of \\\"I\\\" statements as in, \\u201CI manage teams... \\u201D whereas third person (as exemplified above) uses \\u201Che/him\\u201D or \\u201Cshe/her\\\" as in \\\"She manages teams ...\\\" You will find \\u201CAbout Me\\u201D statements written both ways. Most important is that you choose one and remain consistent, rather than alternating between the two. If you\\u2019re writing the \\u2018About\\u2019 statement on a business website, it\\u2019s generally advised to use third person (\\\"She supervises ...\\\"). However, if your website is a personal portfolio or blog, it\\u2019s best to use first person (\\\"I have ten years of experience ...\\\"). Don\\u2019t ramble. Most likely, your reader\\u2019s attention span isn\\u2019t going to be very long. Try to keep your statement to less than 250 words. Include an image. If you\\u2019re promoting your expertise, consider adding a photo to your page. A professional headshot, like you use on LinkedIn, will work perfectly. Website and blog visitors like to connect a name with a face, and it will be more personable if your page isn\\u2019t all plain text. If your website or blog is about a product or service, include a related image. Stay humble. Although it\\u2019s important to include your accomplishments and your experience, do so in a reasonable manner, avoiding outlandish statements. Declarations like, \\u201CI\\u2019m the best marketing professional there is\\u201D or \\u201CAny company that brings me on board is lucky to have me\\u201D will certainly hurt you more than it will help you get hired. Use your own voice. Don\\u2019t use words plucked from the thesaurus or a business book. Use your natural voice, aiming to strike a balance between conversational and professional. You won\\u2019t be introducing yourself in the same way you would be to, say, someone you\\u2019ve just met in a bar, but you also shouldn\\u2019t sound like a politician running for president. Use a tone pitch you should use for networking. Also, be honest about your interests and goals. Go for humor rather than trying to be funny. In some \\u2018About Me\\u2019 pages, you\\u2019ll see that humor can be effective. However, avoid joke telling, especially if it doesn't come naturally. Don\\u2019t feel pressure to sound clever and entertaining. Instead, focus on coming across as approachable, friendly, and engaging. Be honest. Your \\u2018About Me\\u2019 page should reflect your genuine interests, whether they\\u2019re personal or work-related. You never know when someone might use material in your statement to strike up a conversation. For example, if you\\u2019re not really into yoga, don\\u2019t write you\\u2019re into yoga, or if you hate the account management aspect of your job, don\\u2019t write that you\\u2019re passionate about client experience. Proofread, print, and read aloud. Typos make you look careless and reduce the professionalism of your page. Carefully proofread your statement when it\\u2019s complete and ask a friend to do the same. Then, print it out and read it aloud. Not only will this help you catch typos or grammatical mistakes, but it is the best way to ensure the statement reads naturally and sounds like you. If anything comes across as awkward, funny, or simply doesn\\u2019t seem like something you would say, rework it until it sounds more like you. Include links when possible and relevant. Make sure your email address is a link. If you use the word \\u2018experience\\u2019 you can link that to your LinkedIn profile. If you mention any specific projects you\\u2019ve worked on, add links when you can, whether that\\u2019s a link to your portfolio, a positive news article, or even a blog post on your own site that discusses the experience. Update Your Page Regularly Remember that your \\u2018About Me\\u2019 page is a living document. Whenever inspiration strikes, you can (and should) come back and update the page to ensure it accurately reflects where you\\u2019re at in work and in life.
